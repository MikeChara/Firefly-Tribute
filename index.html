        <h3>The Great Betrayal</h3>
        <p>
          Firefly was cancelled due to a per-episode cost of $1million, the
          highest of its time, and viewing figures that did not support this
          cost. Many people believed that, as Firefly was created at a time of
          internet boom, the traditional ways of recording the number of views
          did not do it justice. Many of the shows fans watched it online, where
          their interest was simply not recorded.
        </p>
        <h3>Firefly film</h3>
        <p>
          Despite this cancellation, Joss Whedon found there was considerable
          interest in further production in the Firefly universe, and managed to
          get a film deal with Universal in September 2004.

        <h3>Post-film moments of note</h3>
        <p>
          There have been several periods where hope has been raised for more
          Firefly. There have been cameos by Nathan Fillion in other TV shows,
          such as wearing the famous 'brown coat' during an episode of Castle.
          Perhaps the most controversial moment was Nathan saying he would
          revive the series if he raised a certain amount of money, shortly
          afterwards a gofundme page was raised and the fanbase rose to the
          occasion, only for Nathan to backtrack afterwards
